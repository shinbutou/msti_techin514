The term project aimed to make a smart alarm clock. The project uses the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2 platform. The device hosts a range of sensors, including gyroscope, thermometer, and photoplethysmogram (PPG). The first two are housed on the board itself, saving room for the the internal of the device. The ILI9341 diaply, along with its touchscreen functionality have taken up most of the available pins. My main contribution focused on both the development of hardware and software. The device would track the sleeping cycle of the user with body temperature, heart rate, and movement. Felix and myself has worked on the PCB design together
